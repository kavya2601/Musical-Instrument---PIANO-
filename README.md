# Musical-Instrument---PIANO-
This project is all about the sounds which are produced by piano keys. In this project I have made twelve keys out of which there are seven (7) white keys they are key C , key D , key F , key G , key A , key B and five(5) black keys they are  keyCb , keyDb , keyFb , keyGb,keyAb  . they are also called OCTAVES . Each key have there own specific sound, In this project for each key there is a specific number or alphabet. When ever any of the letter or the number is pressed for the specific key , the key's colour changes.
